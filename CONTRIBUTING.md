# Contributing

If you've found Airer useful, you may consider contributing back to help
improve things further!

Contributing can be done in many different forms, from documentation fixes to
the introduction of new modules. Contributions by all are welcome!


## How to Contribute

To get started, please check out the [issues](/issues) and start a discussion
to show you are interested in working with the community on enhancing Airer.

If you would like to contribute back something that isn't currently tracked in
an issue, please create one to start the discussion. It is important to have
this discussion prior to starting to avoid any surprises late into the
feature's development.
